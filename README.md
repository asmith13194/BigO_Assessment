# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    > method of measurement to measure the overall complexity of an algorithm, helps describe the relative efficiency as a function of the size of the input

---


 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    > Time (speed) and Space (memory)

---


 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    > b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

---



4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   > Binary Search

---



5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)

    > O(log n)

---


 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

    > Time: Constant, Linear, Quadratic

---


7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    > O(log n) is a lookup on an indexed column, O(n log n) is returning the entire search in sorted order on an unindexed column

---

  PART TWO: In a new file, write examples of algorithms/functions for each of the Big O complexities below.
    Upload your file to your repository when complete and submit in Learn --> Exercises.

    1. O(1)

    2. O(n)

    3. O(n^2)
